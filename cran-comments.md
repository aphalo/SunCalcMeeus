I get a NOTE about spelling of Meeus, a surname, and my own surname.

* This is a new package based on functions from my package 'photobiology'. I
plan to remove them from 'photobiology' in its next major release. The reason 
is that 'photobiology' has become too big in size (> 5MB) and too broad in 
scope.

## Answers to CRAN's feedback on the initial submission

* Description: field in DESCRIPTION.

  - Meeus is a surname, not a package name or the like so I left it without quotes
as The CRAN Cookbook says.

  - Citations added to Description: in DESCRIPTION.

* Functions documentation

  - Missing \value fields added as requested.

Thanks for the feedback, and sorry that I missed these glitches before
submission!

Great to see the CRAN Cookbook on-line!
